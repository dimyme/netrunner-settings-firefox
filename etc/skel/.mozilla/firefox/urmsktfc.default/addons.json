Its purpose is to capture video and image files from many sites.\n\nJust surf the Web as you are used to, when DownloadHelper detects it can do something for you, the icon gets animated and a menu allows you to download files by simply clicking an item\n\nFor instance, if you go to a YouTube page, you'll be able to download the video directly on your file system. It also works with MySpace, Google videos, DailyMotion, Porkolt, iFilm, DreamHost and others.\n\nSince version 3.1, you can setup the extension to automatically convert the downloaded movies to your preferred video format.\n\nWhen you are on a page containing links to images or movies, you can download some or all of them at once. Moving the mouse over the items in the menu will highlights the links directly in the page to make sure they are the ones you want to pick up.\n\nDownloadHelper also allows you to download files one by one, so that you keep bandwidth to surf for other stuff to download.\n\nTo modify your preferences, like changing the download directory, right-click on the icon and choose \"Preferences\".\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/manual.php and a faq at http://www.downloadhelper.net/faq.php\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php\n\n***********************\n\nIf you are having problems downloading videos from YouTube, please check this link: http://bugzilla.downloadhelper.net:8080/show_bug.cgi?id=536\n\nUPDATE July 19th 2013:\n\nFor today's youtube changes, please follow this procedure for downloading videos that currently generate empty files:\n\n- Open url \"about:config\"\n- Create a new parameter called \"dwhelper.yt-sig-perm-85\" of type String\n- Set its value to \"[[2,8],[0,1],[9,21],[65,66],[22,65],[84,85],[66,82],[21,22]]\"\n(without the quotes).\n- Reload the youtube page (no need to restart Firefox) and you should be done.\n\nUPDATE July 22nd 2013:\n\n4.9.18 is waiting for approval at Mozilla. This version automatically adapts to YouTube signature changes (responsible for empty downloads) and fixes a few bugs like video variant ordering and removal of audioless or videoless variants.\n\nUPDATE July 24th 2013:\n\nYouTube changed their signature last night.\n\nVersion 4.9.19 is waiting for approval at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/versions/\n\nNote that since 4.9.18, Video DownloadHelper automatically learns the new signatures, but your first downloads just after a signature change may fail. Just reload the YouTube video page, wait for the video to start playing after the ad and retry downloading a few times (generally 1 to 4 attempts are enough to generate the signature).\n\nUPDATE July 26th 2013:\n\nYouTube changed their signature permutation method again last night.\n\n4.9.19 and 4.9.20 has been removed from the Mozilla review pool.\n\nCurrent working version is 4.9.21a1 (soon to be submitted to Mozilla as 4.9.21): http://www.downloadhelper.net/install-beta.php?version=4.9.21a1\n\nDetails here:

do not use comments as support forum.\n\nIf you have problems installing or using DownloadHelper, you should have a look at the following resources:\n\n    the FAQ\n    the manual\n    the guide for video conversion\n\n\nIf you didn't find an answer from the links above, you can fill a support request from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support-expert.php\n\n**********************************************************\n\nTO THOSE WHO LIKE BLEEDING EDGE ADD-ON TECHNOLOGY:\n\nVideo DownloadHelper 4.9 includes a new beta feature: Direct Screen Capture\n\n    - the feature grabs the video directly from the screen. Even if this method has some inconvenience compared to the network capture (the video must be played on your screen the whole duration of the capture), it makes Video DownloadHelper work on all sites, regardless of the underlying streaming protocol. You can also capture videos from a flash applet running in the page which was previously not possible. \n\n\nTo enable that Screen Capture feature:\n\n    make sure you are running at least Firefox 4.0. It won't work on previous versions. If you haven't already done so, upgrade your browser from http://www.getfirefox.com/\n    open the Video DownloadHelper add-on preferences, section \"Capture\", tab \"Screen Capture\" and check the \"Enable Screen capture\" box\n    once the screen capture has been setup, you'll see a new button next to the DownloadHelper toolbar icon. Click it to start the capture of the currently playing video. Click again to stop the capture and save the file. Alternatively, you can use the context menu (right-click in the page but outside the flash area) to choose the screen region to be captured\n\n\nThe Screen Capture feature relies on external tools to do the grabbing, therefore it depends on the platform you are running on:\n\n    on Windows: you will have to also install the CSHelper add-on which provides a modified version of CamStudio. CSHelper and the software applications it contains are open sourced under the GPL license.\n    on Linux, the feature relies by default on the \"recordmydesktop\" application. If you are running Ubuntu, you may have to do \"sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop\" to install that program. On other Linux distributions, you'll figure out. You also may want to use another screen grabbing utility like xvidcap or something else: please let us know about your setup if you succeed\n    on Mac OS X, we haven't yet identified a suitable screen grabbing utility. If you are a Mac warrior and want to make some research on this, we'd love to hear from you","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":4174,"totalDownloads":167462915,"weeklyDownloads":434886,"dailyUsers":6361938,"updateDate":1395674539000,"supportURL":"http://www.downloadhelper.net/documentation.php"},{"id":"langpack-en-ZA@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/6/6180-32.png?modified=1358380391","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/6/6180-64.png?modified=1358380391"},"name":"English (South African) Language Pack","version":"29.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Dwayne Bailey","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dwayne-bailey/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Translate.org.za","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/translateorgza/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Adds South African English language support to the Firefox browser.
