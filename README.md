netrunner-settings-firefox - delete it   NOW  !
===============================================

:-( Containing the firefox profile with settings. These are *very poor settings* and meddle with user settings deliberately, as if the programmer of this extension knows better than the user. Of course, he does not. In fact, settings suggested by this extension are significantly worse than anything the user will come up with. Hence the programmers disallowed complaints via "issues" on github.

Everyone should immediately wipe this malware from one's harddisk. It is no good.

Once you do it, you are once again free to set up your firefox toolbar etc. in a proper way rather than being dictated on by a stupid extension. This project is one of the worst bloatwarez ever. Such a disgrace.
